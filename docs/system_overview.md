## Overview of the system at Avkalan
At Avkalan Labs, we understand that success is not just about setting ambitious goals, but also about having robust systems in place to achieve them. 
We firmly believe in the adage, "We don't rise to the level of our goals; we fall to the level of our systems." This philosophy underscores the importance of a well-structured and cohesive system in guiding our collective efforts towards common objectives. 
Our systems are designed to enable effective communication, efficient tracking, and rapid growth, ensuring that every member of our team is aligned and working in harmony towards our shared vision.

Here's an overview of the key tools that form the backbone of our system at Avkalan:
### Slack
Slack is our primary communication tool, enabling real-time messaging, file sharing, and collaboration across teams. It's organized into channels for different projects and topics, making it easy to stay informed and engaged with relevant discussions.
### Whimsical
Whimsical is a visual collaboration platform we use for creating flowcharts, wireframes, mind maps, and more. It's a powerful tool for brainstorming and visualizing ideas, helping us to plan and communicate complex concepts effectively.
### Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that allows us to track changes in our code and collaborate efficiently. GitHub is a platform that hosts our Git repositories, providing tools for code review, project management, and collaboration. Together, they form the backbone of our development workflow.
### Obsidian
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management tool that uses Markdown for formatting. It's designed for organizing and linking notes, making it ideal for managing documentation, research, and personal knowledge bases.
